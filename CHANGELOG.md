## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-16

A fourth computed blast-radius op-class — **guest-destroy** — on `pve_delete_guest`. Additive and
backward-compatible; tool surface stays **144** (it enriches the existing dry-run preview, adds no
tool). Built test-first, adversarially redteamed, and live read-only-smoked against a real cluster.

### Added
- **Blast-radius op-class #4 — guest-destroy.** `pve_delete_guest` dry-run now computes, at PLAN
  time, what destroying a guest actually does, conditional on the call's `purge`/`force`:
  - **What PVE will REFUSE** (`force` does not override the first two): `protection=1`, a template
    with linked clones (names the clones; detection is config-based — LVM-thin/ZFS/RBD — and carries
    an explicit caveat that directory/qcow2 backing chains are not visible in config), and a running
    guest without `force`. An indeterminate run-state with `force=false` is reported as incomplete,
    never as a clean "go."
  - **References, conditional on `purge`:** HA resource, replication jobs, and explicit backup-job
    vmid lists — phrased as "left dangling" when `purge=false` and "removed by purge" when `purge=true`
    (never the opposite). Pool membership is resolved live via `pool_get`.
  - **Intrinsic removals:** disks + their storages, real snapshots (PVE's synthetic `current`
    live-state row is excluded), and pool membership.
  - **Honesty contract:** every edge is read fail-closed; a failed read flags `complete=False` and
    is never reported as "nothing found"; backup coverage is resolved per mode — `all=1` (covered
    unless excluded), `pool=X` (covered iff target is in that pool, incomplete only if pool data
    unreadable), explicit `vmid` list (direct); only a truly unrecognizable selection stays
    incomplete. The common real-cluster `all=1, exclude=…` config no longer cries "incomplete" on
    every destroy plan. (`compute_guest_destroy_blast` / `gather_guest_dependents`.)

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-16

The blast-radius engine across all op-classes (storage · access/ACL · firewall/network) + a new
onboarding preflight (`pve_doctor`). All additive and backward-compatible; tool surface 143 → **144**.

### Added
- **Computed blast-radius (storage/disk class).** `pve_storage_delete` and `pve_storage_update`
  (disable) now read the cluster at PLAN time and **name the actual guests** that lose disks —
  cluster-wide — distinguishing *"will not boot"* (boot disk / only copy on the storage) from
  *"degraded"* (a non-boot disk lost). Surfaced as `blast_radius` strings **and** a new structured
  `affected: list[dict]` field (additive, non-breaking), and recorded to the PROVE ledger.
  Fail-closed: an incomplete enumeration renders a loud `⚠ INCOMPLETE` marker, never lowers risk,
  and is never read as "nothing affected = safe". New pure engine `proximo.blast` (the graph
  reasoning is unit-tested with zero API). First op-class of the broader blast-radius thesis —
  access/ACL and firewall/network follow the same seam.
  (Spec: `docs/specs/2026-06-15-blast-radius-engine.md`.)
- **Computed blast-radius (access/ACL class).** `pve_acl_modify` now extracts its shadow/widen
  reasoning into the pure `proximo.blast.compute_acl_blast`, populates the structured `affected`
  field, **completes** the target's shadow by resolving their own group-inherited grants (#1), and
  lists who-else-can-reach the path as explicit **UNCHANGED** context (#2). Honest per-principal
  model: only the target gains/loses; group members are never reported as gaining/losing. privsep=1
  tokens do not fold owner groups. Fail-closed throughout (caveat retained when a read fails; risk
  never lowered). (Spec: `docs/specs/2026-06-15-acl-blast-radius.md`.)
- **Computed blast-radius (firewall reach — Part A).** `pve_firewall_rule_add` / `rule_remove` /
  `rule_update` now classify the **per-rule REACH** — *"this rule permits SSH (22/tcp) from
  0.0.0.0/0"* — via the new pure `proximo.blast.compute_firewall_reach`, surfaced as `blast_radius`
  lines **and** the structured `affected` field, recorded to the PROVE ledger. Honest framing:
  reach is a property of **the rule** (what it permits/blocks *if* it is the deciding match in an
  enforced, default-DROP firewall), never an assertion that *"the cluster is exposed"* as fact.
  Missing field → **maximal, never benign**: empty `dport` → ALL ports, empty `source` → anywhere,
  an ipset/alias reference (`+name`/`dc/name`) → unknown-conservative (never "low"). `enable=0` →
  *"staged, not active"*. Removing an ACCEPT names what it **closes**; removing a DROP/REJECT names
  what it **re-permits**; an update classifies the **post-update** rule. Risk is only ever raised,
  never below the MEDIUM floor. (Spec: `docs/specs/2026-06-15-firewall-network-blast-radius.md`.)
- **Computed blast-radius (network-apply lockout — Part B).** `pve_network_apply` now best-effort
  **names the management interface** a network apply would touch: it parses the management host from
  the configured API base URL and, via the pure `proximo.blast.compute_apply_lockout`, names the
  pending interface that carries it (*"this apply changes `vmbr0`, which holds the management host —
  you will lose SSH/API"*), surfaced as `blast_radius` lines + the structured `affected` field.
  This sits on top of the **unconditional `RISK_HIGH`** that network apply already carries — naming
  the interface can only add specificity, never lower risk. Honest by construction: a hostname
  management host, an addressless interface read, a non-pending match, or a read failure all yield
  *"could not identify the management interface — HIGH stands; assume lockout risk"*, **never** "no
  lockout". `pve_sdn_apply` gains a light note that the management path is normally on a plain
  bridge, not an SDN vnet. (Spec: `docs/specs/2026-06-15-firewall-network-blast-radius.md`.)
- **`pve_doctor` — onboarding preflight (read-only).** Checks API reachability + reads the calling
  token's *effective* permissions, then reports what the token CAN / CANNOT do — with the privilege
  + role to grant for each gap. Turns raw `403`s into an actionable checklist; run it first after
  install to verify config/token before wiring Proximo into an MCP client. Routed through the PROVE
  ledger as a read; same advisory posture as DIAGNOSE. Per-capability match-mode prevents overclaim
  (rollback is its own capability — `VM.Snapshot` without `VM.Snapshot.Rollback` is reported as
  create-only, never "UNDO works"). Adds `ApiBackend.version()` + `access_permissions()`. Brings the
  tool surface to **144** — the prior 0.2.0 docs' "144" was an off-by-one (the shipped artifact
  served 143); with `pve_doctor` the documented count is now accurate.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-15

Complete the four **half-built planes** to total CRUD coverage. **26 new MCP tools**
(surface now 144), each wearing the PLAN + PROVE trust substrate by construction, built
test-first, adversarially redteamed, and — where the operation is a reversible config-object
edit — **live-proven on a real PVE 9.2 node**.

### Added
- **Firewall objects plane (11 tools)** — aliases (`list`/`create`/`update`/`delete`),
  IP-sets (`create`/`delete` + entry `add`/`remove`), security groups (`create`/`delete`),
  and firewall `options_set`. Scope-aware (cluster/node/guest) via `_fw_base`.
- **HA rules plane (3 tools)** — `ha_rule_create`/`update`/`delete`, the PVE 9 replacement
  for the deprecated HA groups. Auto-detects the groups→rules migration and surfaces it
  honestly rather than 500-ing.
- **SDN plane (10 tools)** — zones (`create`/`update`/`delete`), VNets
  (`create`/`update`/`delete`), subnets (`list`/`create`/`update`/`delete`). New objects stay
  *pending* until `sdn_apply`, so create→delete reverts cleanly with no effect on the
  production network. (`sdn_apply` is unchanged — not re-added here.)
- **TFA admin (2 tools)** — `tfa_get`, `tfa_delete`. PVE gates TFA *mutation* behind a
  ticket-based login session, not an API token: `tfa_delete` is shape-correct and reaches the
  API but is ticket-gated (403 with a token); reads work via token. TFA enrollment remains out
  of scope (interactive challenge→confirm).

### Changed
- `pyright` is scoped to `src/` (`[tool.pyright] include = ["src"]`) so the default run
  reflects the shipped package; structural test-double type noise no longer pollutes the clean
  signal. Tests stay inspectable on demand (`pyright tests/`).

---

## [0.1.2] — 2026-06-14

Distribution + supply-chain hardening. No changes to the MCP/A2A surface or behavior.

### Added
- **GHCR container image** — a release workflow builds and publishes a multi-arch
  (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) image to `ghcr.io/john-broadway/proximo` on each GitHub
  Release. `docker run -i --rm … ghcr.io/john-broadway/proximo` runs the stdio MCP server on
  demand — no daemon, no open port. Images ship with an SBOM and a sigstore-signed
  build-provenance attestation (`gh attestation verify oci://… --owner john-broadway`).

### Security
- **CI / supply-chain hardening** (independent 3-lens review): workflows default to
  `permissions: contents: read`; the publish and signing actions are pinned by commit SHA
  with a Dependabot keeper; the Docker build uses an allow-list `COPY` so a local build
  can't bake stray secrets into the image.

---

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-10 — "Spaniard"

Hardening + release-readiness pass driven by an independent multi-team audit (3 cold reviewers,
40 doc claims source-verified, full-history leak audit, adversarial verification of every finding).

### Added
- **Realm options dict** (`8d2dac0`): `pve_realm_create` and `pve_realm_update` now accept a
  type-specific `options` dict — LDAP (`server1`/`base_dn`/`user_attr`), AD (`domain`/`server1`),
  OpenID (`issuer-url`/`client-id`). Previously, creating any LDAP/AD/OpenID realm was impossible
  through the tool. Live-proven against a real PVE 9.2 API.
- **Governance/dangerous plane — live-proven to execute** (milestone): the governance and dangerous
  plane (identity role/group/user/ACL; storage; SDN apply; network apply; realm create) that was
  previously built+redteamed but MOCKED-only is now **proven to execute create→read→delete against
  a real PVE 9.2 API on a nested test cluster**. Also proven on a nested 3-node test cluster:
  offline guest migration (including local-disk) and HA-config operations (resource add/list/remove)
  execute. PROVE ledger verified throughout. **Honest scope:** "nested test cluster" — not
  production scale; HA **fencing** (hardware watchdog) and **online** live-migration (shared storage)
  remain unproven.
- **CI**: GitHub Actions workflow — ruff + the full pytest suite on Python 3.12 and 3.13.

### Security
- **A2A perimeter hardening** (`a8ce10b`, `0d952a6`): fail-closed by design — non-localhost bind
  is **refused** unless `PROXIMO_A2A_TOKEN_FILE` is set; bearer auth (constant-time comparison) on
  the JSON-RPC control endpoint when a token is set; Host-header allowlist + DNS-rebind defense
  (`PROXIMO_A2A_ALLOWED_HOSTS`); `'*'` in the allowlist warns rather than silently disabling. The
  agent card declares the bearer scheme. localhost-default dev behavior unchanged; A2A stays opt-in.
- **Audit ledger file permissions:** the ledger is now created `0600` (owner-only) instead of the
  umask default — entries can carry command/SQL detail and were world-readable on typical umasks.
  Applies at creation; an existing file keeps the mode its operator set.

### Fixed
- Realm create/update no longer silently ignores type-specific options (LDAP/AD/OpenID realms
  were uncreatable before this fix).
- **Audit-integrity:** `ct_logs` now enforces the CTID allowlist at the server layer like its
  siblings — a forbidden CTID ledgers as `blocked:allowlist` instead of surfacing as a backend error,
  so allowlist denials are uniformly traceable in the PROVE ledger. Blocked entries for read-only
  tools (`ct_logs`, `ct_diagnose`) now ledger `mutation: false`, matching the tool's true class.
- **Packaging:** `proximo-a2a` without the `[a2a]` extra now prints a one-line
  `pip install "proximo[a2a]"` hint (exit 2) instead of a raw `ModuleNotFoundError` traceback —
  including when only `uvicorn` is missing; a missing *submodule* of an installed dependency still
  tracebacks (that is a real environment bug, not a missing extra).

### Notes
- **117 MCP tools; 1964 tests passing (0 skipped); ruff clean.** Published 2026-06-10 — GitHub + PyPI (`proximo-proxmox`); GHCR pending.
- Docs: public-readiness scrub of ROADMAP/CHANGELOG/POSITIONING; README install command made
  copy-pasteable; claim wording tightened to carry its own scope. Lint: 3 leftover warnings in the
  live-smoke scripts cleaned.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-09 — "Spaniard"

First blood — the foundation of the ethical Proxmox MCP. _Tagged `v0.1.0`; not yet published to
PyPI/GHCR (local/private). Honest scope: 117 MCP tools, most exercised against mocks only; the trust
spine + core lifecycle are live-proven, the governance plane is built/redteamed but not yet live-fired._

### Added
- **MCP stdio transport, proven end-to-end:** `python -m proximo` entry point; the `initialize` handshake
  advertises Proximo's own version (not the MCP SDK's); covered by a real-client integration test
  (`test_mcp_stdio_e2e.py`: client → stdio → FastMCP dispatch → tool → back).
- Two backends: **REST API management** (scoped token) + **`ssh`→`pct` in-container exec** (local or remote).
- **MCP tool surface** (FastMCP): `pve_node_status`, `pve_list_guests`, `pve_guest_status`,
  `pve_guest_power`, `ct_exec`, `ct_psql`, `ct_logs`.
- **Ethical spine:** append-only audit log (records real outcomes), confirm-gates on every mutating tool,
  fail-closed CTID allowlist, input validation on API path components (vmid/kind/node).
- Tests (13) + ruff lint config. Clean run.

### Security
- Security redteam (2026-06-07): **5 findings, all fixed** —
  `ct_exec`/`ct_psql` now confirm-gated; allowlist now fails **closed**; audit records real outcomes
  (errors included); `vmid`/`kind`/`node` validated against injection; TLS-disabled now warns.
- Verified solid: command injection (shlex-correct on local + ssh + psql paths); the API token is never
  logged, never enters the audit log, subprocess argv, or error messages.

### PROVE pillar — tamper-evident ledger (2026-06-07)
- The audit log is now a **hash-chained, tamper-evident ledger**: `entry_hash = sha256(prev_hash + body)`,
  flock-guarded, fsync'd. `verify()` and the `audit_verify` MCP tool detect any altered / deleted /
  inserted / reordered entry and pinpoint the break; `head()` is anchorable off-box. Tamper-**evident**,
  not tamper-proof (honestly scoped). +6 tamper-detection tests. Redteam: 2 findings fixed.
- This is one of the four trust-layer pillars (PLAN · UNDO · **PROVE** · DIAGNOSE) — see POSITIONING.md.

### PLAN pillar — dry-run by default (2026-06-07)
- New `proximo.planning` module: **every mutating tool now previews before it acts.** Called without
  `confirm=True`, `pve_guest_power` / `ct_exec` / `ct_psql` return a **plan** — the exact change, the
  guest's live state (power), blast radius, and an **advisory, heuristic risk rating** — instead of
  executing. `confirm=True` then executes. You structurally cannot mutate without a plan first existing.
- **PLAN ⊗ PROVE:** the previewed plan (including the live state it was based on) is written to the
  tamper-evident ledger with `outcome="planned"`; a confirmed execution records `confirmed=true`. The
  approval trail — *what preview was shown before the action* — is now verifiable, not just *that* it ran.
- **Honest by design (guard every path to LOW):** `LOW` means "does not change state," not "safe";
  the absence of a `HIGH` flag is not a safety signal; destructive signatures are curated, not exhaustive.
- Adversarial review: confirmed bypasses fixed — whitelist audit (`find -delete`, `ip route add`,
  `mount <dev>` no longer rate "read-only"); SQL `SELECT pg_terminate_backend()/lo_import()`,
  `COPY ... PROGRAM` (RCE) now escalate; failed dry-runs are audited; `current` state recorded; latent
  `_max_risk`/`_fmt_uptime` edge crashes fixed. Every confirmed bypass became a regression test.
- Tests: **81 total** (was 21), ruff clean.
- **Guarantee enforced:** the plan is recorded on BOTH paths — even a one-shot `confirm=True` records
  its `planned` entry before mutating (no plan, no mutation). The PLAN→PROVE triplet
  (`planned → ok/confirmed`) is uniform; a one-shot confirm can't bypass the recorded preview.

### UNDO pillar — auto-snapshot before mutating + one-call revert (2026-06-07)
- **Snapshot backend + tools:** `pve_snapshot_list` (read), `pve_snapshot_create`, `pve_rollback`
  (DESTRUCTIVE — discards changes since the snapshot), `pve_snapshot_delete` (all PLAN-gated), and
  `pve_task_status` to poll the async task UPIDs these return. Endpoints verified against PVE docs.
- **The headline — auto-undo before exec:** `ct_exec`/`ct_psql` gain `snapshot=True`. With `confirm=True`
  it takes a `proximo_undo_<ts>` snapshot **and waits for the task to finish** before running the
  mutation, records the undo point, and returns it. **Fail-closed:** if the snapshot can't be created
  or doesn't finish OK (e.g. storage doesn't support snapshots), the command is **NOT run**.
- **Honest:** snapshots are storage-dependent (ZFS/BTRFS/LVM-thin; not directory/raw) — surfaced in the
  plan, never assumed. Rollback's PLAN spells out the blast radius. Async ops record `outcome="submitted"`
  (not "ok") so the ledger never claims an in-flight task is done.
- Adversarial review: confirmed fixes, each a regression test — regex anchors `$`→`\Z` (newline bypass),
  UPID length cap + reserved-name (`current`) guard, microsecond-unique undo names, strict task-exit
  (fail-closed on missing `exitstatus`), server-layer allowlist gate (no orphaned snapshot for a
  forbidden CTID), non-contradictory rollback preview when the snapshot is missing.
- Tests: **116 total**, ruff clean.

### DIAGNOSE pillar — read-first "what's broken" (2026-06-07)
- New `proximo.diagnose` module + tools: `ct_diagnose` (API guest status + a FIXED read-only
  in-container battery — failed units, disk, recent errors, memory, listening ports) and
  `pve_diagnose` (node status + storage usage + recent failed tasks). Both strictly READ-ONLY
  (no confirm, no mutation), audited. Backend reads: `node_storage`, `node_tasks`.
- **Honest by design:** advisory flags, never causation ("signal present", not "the cause is X").
  Flags also surface **incompleteness** — partial mode (exec off → API-only + a skipped-probes flag),
  a failed read, or a failed probe all flag, so an empty `flags` list can never read as a false clean
  bill of health. Inactive/offline storage is reported as offline, not as "full" (no stale-data alarm).
- Adversarial review — read-only guarantee held (no injection, gates correct); the task-list `status`
  field was **verified against the live PVE API**. Fixes, each a regression test: incompleteness flags,
  inactive-storage handling, removed dead `--no-legend` guard, `_frac` inf/overflow guard, transient/
  WARNINGS tasks no longer counted as failed, `node_tasks` limit clamp, `ExecBackend` vmid validation.
- Tests: **141 total**, ruff clean. **All four trust-layer pillars (PLAN · UNDO · PROVE · DIAGNOSE) now built.**

### Coverage expansion — phases 1–7 (2026-05 → 2026-06)
- Grew the MCP surface from the 7 foundation tools to **117** `@mcp.tool()` tools, every mutating one
  wearing PLAN+UNDO+PROVE by construction: provisioning/backup/restore, config/disk/cloud-init mutation, the
  four "dangerous plane" domains (**firewall · network/SDN · cluster HA/migration · ACL/users/roles/realms**),
  observability, task/pool control, storage admin, and **PBS-native** deep tools (GC/verify/prune/snapshots/
  namespaces; separate `:8007` backend, TLS fail-closed).
- **Live-proven** against a real PVE: the core provisioning/config mutate cycle (create→config→revert→
  clone→backup→restore→delete, ledger verified) + read shapes across node/storage/observability + a
  PBS datastore. **Honest scope:** the bulk of the 117-tool surface — *including the dangerous plane* —
  is **MOCKED-only** (unit-tested against fakes, not fired against real Proxmox). A broad live smoke needs a
  wider scoped token. See the `ROADMAP.md` reality-check and `LANDSCAPE.md`.

### A2A (Agent2Agent) face — experimental (2026-06-09)
- Optional second protocol head (`pip install 'proximo[a2a]'` → `proximo-a2a`): a curated **16-skill slice**
  exposed over A2A, routing to the same server tools so PLAN/PROVE/UNDO/fail-closed are inherited. Serves an
  agent card at `/.well-known/agent-card.json`; localhost by default (no built-in auth — warns on
  non-localhost). Built + redteamed (PLAN-bypass + slice-boundary: **0 findings**); +47 tests. **Proven
  end-to-end against a real a2a-sdk client** — agent-card resolve over HTTP + a real `message/send` invoking a
  skill → completed task with a `result` artifact (real-socket proof + an in-process integration test,
  `test_a2a_e2e.py`).

### PROVE — opt-in HMAC-keyed audit chain (2026-06-09)
- The audit ledger now supports an **opt-in keyed mode**: set `PROXIMO_AUDIT_KEY_PATH` to chain entries
  with **HMAC-SHA256** instead of bare SHA-256 (key auto-generated at 0600 via an atomic temp+link, hex
  stored, fail-closed on empty/non-hex/<32-byte). The **ledger's key is authoritative** — a downgrade
  (strip the HMAC, recompute as SHA-256 without the key) is rejected; a keyed log must be all-keyed. Default
  stays **unkeyed and byte-identical** (existing logs + tests unaffected); `audit_verify` reports `keyed`.
  Adversarial review (forge / key-handling / verify lenses): no exploitable forgery; +12 tests incl. the downgrade
  attack. **Honest scope:** keying resists forward-rewrite by an attacker *without* the key, but a same-user
  attacker who can write the 0600 log can often read the 0600 key — the **off-box `head()` anchor remains
  the strong guarantee.** Not a "cryptographic depth" moat.

### Honesty note (2026-06-09)
- The PBS cert fingerprint is stored but **not yet wire-enforced**.

### Notes
- Not yet released; **pre-alpha.** Apache-2.0 LICENSE: ✅ added. Pending: broad live smoke of the
  mocked surface (needs a properly-scoped token), publish (PyPI/GHCR + CI) so the install commands work.

_Strength and honor._
