"""Proximo's A2A (Agent2Agent) face — a transport on the governed core.

Proximo is an MCP server first (see ``proximo.server``). This package adds an OPTIONAL A2A face so
Proximo can also be a first-class Agent2Agent participant — "the Proxmox operator agent" other
agents can call.

Design (one core, interchangeable transports):
    The A2A face exposes the FULL governed tool surface and routes every call through
    ``proximo.governed.call_governed`` — the same spine path (PLAN-by-default, PROVE, UNDO, the
    gates, the token scope) an MCP client takes. It reimplements no management or trust logic and
    curates no per-transport slice: a transport carries the surface, it does not curate it.

Layering (import-safe):
    - ``card``     — builds the ``AgentCard`` from the governed surface (needs a2a-sdk).
    - ``executor`` — the ``AgentExecutor`` that routes a call through the governed core (needs a2a-sdk).
    - ``app``      — the Starlette/JSON-RPC server + ``proximo-a2a`` entrypoint (needs a2a-sdk + uvicorn).

The a2a-sdk is an OPTIONAL dependency (``pip install 'proximo-proxmox[a2a]'``); the shared perimeter
(``proximo.webguard``) and dispatch (``proximo.governed``) are dependency-light so the contract is
always importable.
