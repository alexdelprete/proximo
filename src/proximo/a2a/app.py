"""Proximo A2A server application factory + ``proximo-a2a`` entrypoint.

Wires the A2A SDK's request-handler stack into a Starlette ASGI app. The executor
(``ProximoAgentExecutor``) is imported from the sibling ``.executor`` module; this module owns
the plumbing (routes, card, handler, auth) and the ``main`` entry point.

Security model (fail-closed, like the rest of Proximo):
  - Default bind is loopback (``127.0.0.1``) — not reachable off-box.
  - The A2A face is a network CONTROL PLANE over Proxmox. Binding it to any non-localhost address
    is REFUSED unless an auth token is configured (``PROXIMO_A2A_TOKEN_FILE``) — a hard error, not a
    warning. "Exposed by accident" is structurally impossible.
  - When a token is configured, the JSON-RPC control endpoint requires ``Authorization: Bearer
    <token>`` (constant-time compared). The agent card stays readable so A2A clients can discover
    how to authenticate.
